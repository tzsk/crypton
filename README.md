TThis is a simple package for laravel to encrypt decrypt api request & response in both ends, Backend & Javascript.

## :package: Installation

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require tzsk/crypton
```

Publish config file

```bash
$ php artisan crypton:publish
```

Add an environment variable in the `.env` file

```env
CRYPTON_KEY=your-encryption-key
```

## :eyes: Keep in Mind

> **TIP:** You can easily generate an encryption key by running `php artisan key:generate` then copy the generated key. Then again run: `php artisan key:generate` to make the key used by crypton and the default application key different.

**WARNING: DO NOT USE THE SAME `APP_KEY` AND `CRYPTON_KEY`**

## :fire: Usage

Start off by adding a Middleware in the `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

```php
$routeMiddleware = [
    'crypton' => \Tzsk\Crypton\Middleware\EncryptRequestResponse::class,
];
```

Now, add this middleware to any api routes or groups.

Example:

```php
Route::middleware('crypton')->post('some-endpoint', function(Request $request) {
    return Post::paginate($request->per_page ? : 10);
});
```

That's it.
